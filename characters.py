Last week alone, I wasted $50,000 on a 'revolutionary' system that crashed within two days. My CFO is breathing down my neck about our tech budget, and my team is getting fed up with constant changes.

I've practiced this speech a hundred times, but now I can't remember a single word. What if I stutter? What if they ask questions I can't answer? What if I trip walking to the podium like I did in college? My hands are shaking so bad I can barely hold my notes. This promotion depends on this presentation, and I'm about to ruin everything!
