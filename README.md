# Mimica: A Friendly Chatbot Game
Mimica is an app where you can have conversations with AI characters who have their own feelings. It is built using Python and Streamlit to make talking with AI feel more humanlike. You can talk to characters who are sad, angry, or anxious, and your goal is to help them feel better by being a good friend. There's a happiness meter that shows you how you're doing, which makes each chat feel like a small, fun game about empathy.

## What It Can Do
Five Different AI Characters: You can talk to five unique characters, each with their own personality and story.

See Your Impact in Real-Time: A "happiness meter" goes up or down depending on how you talk to the characters.

Smart Scoring: The app uses a smart AI system (GPT-4o mini) to understand how empathetic your messages are. It also has a simple backup scoring system so it never breaks.

Realistic Conversations: The characters' replies are generated by GPT-4.1 to make the chats feel natural and engaging.
## Technologies
Code: Python 3.9+

Website: Streamlit

AI Brain: OpenAI API

API Key Setup: python-dotenv

## How the Files Are Organized
The app is run from main.py, which acts like a traffic controller, directing the user to the right page. All the settings and session information are handled by config.py, and the app's unique look comes from the code in styles.py.

The heart of the game's logic is in a few key files. characters.py contains the personalities and stories for each AI friend. The "brain" of the game is in emotion_analysis.py, which holds the smart logic for scoring the conversation and generating the AI's replies. chat_history.py gives the app a memory, allowing it to save and load past chats.

Finally, the pages/ folder contains the code for each screen the user sees: the welcome.py screen, the selection.py screen for choosing a character, and the chat.py screen where the conversation happens.

## Working
Here are the steps to get the project working on your own computer.

1. Set Up a Virtual Environment
->On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

->On Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

2. Installations
This command will install all the packages the project needs to run.
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add Your API Key
The app needs an OpenAI API key to work.

In the main project folder, create a new file and name it .env.

Open that file and add your key like this:

OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

4. Run the App
Now you're ready to go! Just run this command in your terminal:

streamlit run main.py

The app should open up in your web browser.

## How to Play
On the welcome screen, click the "Start Helping Friends!" button.

Next, you'll see the character selection screen. Read about the characters and pick one to talk to.

Once you're in the chat, just type your messages to help them out.

Keep an eye on the happiness meter and the pop up messages to see how you're doing.

The goal is to get their happiness up to 100% to win!# Mimica
